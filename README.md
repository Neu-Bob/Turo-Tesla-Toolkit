This section is specifically for documentation of the rental process and helpful guides and checklists, etc

1. Documentation for Owners including, car prep check list, check out task list, check in task list
2. Documentation for Renters including, quick tips for cars based on models and features

The purpose of this is to create a guide to use when delivering a Tesla to a new Turo renter.  As a Tesla Model 3 owner that is offering my car via Turo I want to be able to give new Tesla drivers a walkthrough of systems and procedures as well as expected charging behavior, etc.
