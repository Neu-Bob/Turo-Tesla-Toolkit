# tesla_turo_renter_walkthrough

The purpose of this is to create a guide to use when delivering a Tesla to a new Turo renter.  As a Tesla Model 3 owner that is offering my car via Turo I want to be able to give new Tesla drivers a walkthrough of systems and procedures as well as expected charging behavior, etc.
