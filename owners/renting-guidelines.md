Please do not smoke, vape or allow pets in the vehicle.

There will be a $150 cleaning fee charged if smoking, vaping or pets pet odor is detected in the vehcicle. 

Please be very careful to not hit curbs or potholes with the vehicle.  The wheels are difficult and expensive to repair.  A fee of $200 for each wheel with curb damage will be assessed.  If tires have any rubber gashes or divots there will be a $250 charge for each tire.  The Tesla Model 3 is a very heavy vehcicle, weighing in at almost 4,000 lbs because of the weight of the battery.  Please be careful

CHARGING:
Since this is an electric vehicle, you must charge it when the state of charge gets low, preferably before it reaches 10%.  The easiest way to charge is at any Tesla supercharging location, which can be found via the navigation system.  You will be charged $0.29 per kWh (kilowatt hour) of electricity.  Under normal driving conditions, the vehicle consumes 1 kWh for every 3 miles driven, so this fee will generally be roughly $0.29 x 1/3 of the miles driven. These charges will be invoiced to you after the vehicle is returned, usually within 48 hours.

Thus, if you drive 1000 miles, you can expect to pay about $96 in supercharging fees. 

Compared to a typical gas vehicle that gets 25 mpg, with a gasoline price of $3.00 per gallon, 1000 miles would cost about $120.

In addition to supercharging, you can also use the provided cables to plug the vehicle in to a standard wall outlet.  You can also use the included adapters to use non-tesla chargers, but you will be responsible for paying those fees yourself at the time of charging.  Be aware that non-tesla chargers typically take much longer to charge (2-3x longer at a minimum) and that wall outlet charging can take up to 15-20x longer, thus should only be used in emergencies.

Finally, if you allow the vehicle to run out of power, you will have to have the vehicle towed on a flat-bed truck at your own expense to the nearest supercharger, as well as pay for any damage that might be incurred from such towing. Never let the charge go below 30 miles remaining.  The milage shown on the instrument screen is only an estimate, and can vary based on road conditions, geography, temperature, speed, and weather.

In addition, if you lose or damage the charging cables or adapters, you will be charged $350 for replacement.  If you use Tesla chargers you will not need to use the provided cables at all.
