Please do not smoke or vape in or around the vehicle.  No pets.

There will be a $150 cleaning fee charged if smoking or vaping is detected in the vehicle, and a $150 fee if pets are found to have been in the vehicle.

Please avoid hitting curbs and potholes with the vehicle.  The wheels are difficult and expensive to repair.  A fee of $200 for each wheel with curb damage will be assessed, as well as a fee for any damage to tires.  This is a very heavy vehicle 5,000 pounds because of the battery weight, so be careful.

CHARGING:

Since this is an electric vehicle, you must charge it when the state of charge gets low.  The easiest way to do this is at any tesla supercharging location, which can be found via the vehicles navigation system.  You will be charged $0.26 per kWh (kilowatt hour) of electricity.  Under normal driving conditions, the vehicle consumes 1 kWh for every 3 miles driven, so this fee will generally be roughly $0.26 x 1/3 of the miles driven.

Thus, if you drive 1000 miles, you can expect to pay about $86 in supercharging fees. 

Compared to a typical gas vehicle that gets 25 mpg, with a gasoline price of $2.75 per gallon, 1000 miles would cost about $110.

In addition to supercharging, you can also plug the vehicle in to a standard wall outlet, using the cables provided.  You can also use the included adapters to use non-tesla chargers, but you will be responsible for paying those fees yourself at the time of charging.  Be aware that non-tesla chargers typically take much longer to charge (2-3x longer at a minimum) and that wall outlet charging can take up to 15-20x longer, thus should only be used in emergencies.

Finally, if you allow the vehicle to run out of power, you will have to have the vehicle towed on a flat-bed truck at your own expense to the nearest supercharger, as well as pay for any damage that might be incurred from such towing, so I advise you to never let the charge go below 30 miles remaining.  The milage shown on the instrument  panel is only an estimate, and can vary based on road conditions, geography, temperature, speed, and weather.

In addition, if you lose or damage the charging cables or adapters, you will be charged $360 for replacement.  You do not need to use them at all when using the Tesla supercharger
