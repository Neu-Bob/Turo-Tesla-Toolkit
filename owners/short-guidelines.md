# Overview

I treat this car with great care and respect and I ask you to do the same.

# Cleanliness

Please do not:

* Allow pets
* Smoke or vape in or immediately before entering the car
* Carry sharp objects
* Leave any trash or personal belongings
* Bring the car back dirty; only use touchless car wash
* Open any food or drinks inside

I may assess cleaning fees after the trip:

* $20 for a car wash
* $150 for light to moderate interior cleaning
* $250 for "severe" interior cleaning (smoking, vaping, pet hair, spilled food or drink)
* Full price for scrapes and other damage done to the paint if you try to hide dirt or wipe it off

# Damage to Vehicle or Accessories

Teslas are fun to drive, but you need to be responsible. Please do not:

* Disable Tesla mobile access
* Drive recklessly or offroad
* Hit curbs or take steep driveways or hills at excessive speed
* Do burnouts
* Exceed 100 MPH. I will be notified and lower the maximum speed available to you.

Many parts on these cars (and the cars themselves) are expensive. I may charge damage fees after the trip:

* $300 per wheel damaged by curbing
* $250 per tire for excessive wear or severe damage

If you see a "Sentry alert" on the center console any time you get in the car and spot damage to the vehicle, please notify us immediately.

Please notify us of any major incidents immediately and minor incidents upon returning the vehicle.

# EV Charging

Look for red markers on the navigation map. They are Tesla Superchargers. They are inexpensive to use (about $15 per fill-up) and the fastest way to get back to enjoying the car. If you are staying at an Airbnb or hotel, look for properties that have partnered with Tesla to provide free overnight charging for their guests. It is very nice waking up to a full charge every day. You may also use public chargers with J-1772 plugs or NEMA 14-50 (aka "dryer outlets") but they will not charge as quickly as Superchargers. You may use a regular household outlet in an emergency, but it will not meet your daily needs.

I charge $350 to replace any lost or damaged charging components I've included in the car. The best way to avoid that fee is to not use those items. Stick to Superchargers or properties that offer Tesla-branded overnight charging.

**You will be responsible for covering all fees related to charging regardless of how the car car is charged. Turo offers an unlimited supercharging option for $20/day. This allows for easy, low-stress road trips. Note that Tesla may charge $1/minute if you don't move the car after it is done supercharging. The Turo fee does not cover that excess charge or fees incurred at non-Tesla public chargers.**

The main battery is the most expensive part of the car. To take good care of it, please do not:

* Drive the car with less than 10% except directly to a charger
* Charge the battery to over 90% unless you are immediately driving for half an hour or more
* Park the car overnight with battery levels below 10% or over 90%

If you completely drain the battery and become stranded, you will need to pay for a flatbed tow to the nearest supercharger, the cost of supercharging, and I will assess a vehicle damage fee for the damage you have caused to the battery.

# Tolls and Violations

Feel free to bring and use your own electronic toll tag. You are responsible for all toll fees incurred during your booking.

If you are ticketed for any reason please let us know immediately upon return. All fines or traffic violations are the sole responsibility of the guest during the rental period, including but not limited to speed tickets arriving by mail after your rental period has ended.

# Extending Trips

If you'd like to extend your trip, please go into your trip in the app and select CHANGE TRIP. I will allow you to extend the trip so long as the calendar is open. This will prevent a late fee and does not require you to call support.

# Summary

I know this was long, but the car is worth it. This car is amazing and we want you to have a memorable experience. Thank you for reading, and we hope to see you soon.
