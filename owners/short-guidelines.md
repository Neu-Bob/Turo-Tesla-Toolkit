# Overview

I treat this car with great care and respect and I ask you to do the same.

# Cleanliness

Please do not:

* Allow pets
* Smoke or vape in or immediately before entering the car
* Carry sharp objects
* Leave any trash or personal belongings
* Bring the car back dirty; only use touchless car wash
* Open any food or drinks inside

I may assess cleaning fees after the trip:

* $20 for a car wash
* $150 for light to moderate interior cleaning
* $250 for "severe" interior cleaning (smoking, vaping, pet hair, spilled food or drink)
* Full price for scrapes and other damage done to the paint if you try to hide dirt or wipe it off

# Damage to Vehicle or Accessories

Teslas are fun to drive, but you need to be responsible. Please do not:

* Disable Tesla mobile access
* Drive recklessly doing burnouts or offroading
* Hit curbs or take steep driveways or hills at excessive speed
* Exceed 100 MPH. I will be notified and lower the maximum speed available to you.

Many parts on these cars (and the cars themselves) are expensive. I may charge damage fees after the trip:

* $300 per wheel damaged by curbing
* $250 per tire for excessive wear or severe damage

If you see a "Sentry alert" on the center console any time you get in the car and spot damage to the vehicle, please notify us immediately.

Please notify us of any major incidents immediately and minor incidents upon returning the vehicle.

# EV Charging

Look for red markers on the navigation map. They are Tesla Superchargers. They are inexpensive to use (about $15 per fill-up) and the fastest way to get back to enjoying the car. If you are staying at an Airbnb or hotel, look for properties that have partnered with Tesla to provide free overnight charging for their guests. It is very nice waking up to a full charge every day. You may also use public chargers with J-1772 plugs or NEMA 14-50 (aka "dryer outlets") but they will not charge as quickly as Superchargers. You may use a regular household outlet in an emergency, but it will not meet your daily needs.

I charge $350 to replace any lost or damaged charging components I've included in the car. The best way to avoid that fee is to not use those items. Stick to Superchargers or properties that offer Tesla-branded overnight charging.

The main battery is the most expensive part of the car. To take good care of it, please do not:

* Drive the car with less than 10% charge except directly to a charger
* Charge the battery to over 90% unless you are immediately driving for half an hour or more
* Park the car overnight with battery levels below 10% or over 90%
* Manually close the charge port door; it will close by itself

If you completely drain the battery and become stranded, you will need to pay for:

* a flatbed tow to the nearest supercharger
* the cost of any damages caused by towing it
* the cost of the supercharging session
* a vehicle damage fee for the damage you have caused to the battery

**You will be responsible for covering all fees related to charging regardless of how the car car is charged, including any idling fees incurred by failing to move the car after it is fully charged. Turo offers an unlimited supercharging option for $20/day. This allows for easy, low-stress road trips when using Tesla Superchargers, but does not cover idling fees or fees charged by other parties.**

# Tolls and Violations

Feel free to bring and use your own electronic toll tag. You are responsible for all toll fees and violations incurred during your booking.

If you are ticketed for any reason please let us know immediately upon return. You are solely responsible for all fines or traffic violations incurred during the rental period.

# Extending Trips

If you'd like to extend your trip, please go into your trip in the app and select CHANGE TRIP. I will allow you to extend the trip so long as the calendar is open. This will prevent a late fee and does not require you to call support.

# Summary

I know this was long, but the car is worth it. This car is amazing and we want you to have a memorable experience. Thank you for reading, and we hope to see you soon.
