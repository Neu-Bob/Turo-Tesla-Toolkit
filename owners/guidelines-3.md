No pets allowed in the Tesla Model 3. 
No smoking or drug use is allowed in the vehicle.
$750 Cleaning charges will be applied. 
Cleaning fees will be charged for any crumbs, spills or stickiness seen in the vehicle upon return.

Absolutely no smoking

PLEASE do not continue to drive the car below 10%, I would begin to look for a charging station. 
Simply hold the right button on the steering wheel and say “directions to nearest super charging station”. Allowing these cars to get to 0% can cause permanent damage.

I would also recommend only charging the car to 90% or less, charging to 100% causes the battery to degrade much faster.

⚡️CHARGING ⚡️

• The car is delivered with at least 250 miles of range @ trip start; it is expected to be returned with the same amount of miles it had when trip started otherwise a $10 convenience fee + regular cost of charging will apply. (Unless you bought the Prepaid dropoff fee, see below)

• All charging fees incurred at Tesla supercharging network during your trip will be billed through my Tesla account and then requested through Turo after the vehicle is returned for Reimbursement.

🔌🔋CHARGING PACKAGES AVAILABLE 🔌🔋

1) Save time @ dropoff & Skip charging the car to same level by adding a Prepaid EV package available in the “Extras” section, now only $20!

⚠️ Please return with at least 40-50 miles of charge at dropoff so the car can make it to the closest Tesla charging station. (Towing Fees may incur if we cannot reach the closest Chargers)
*** Draining the battery less than 40 miles and close to 0 may damage the battery 

🛑 IDLING FEES (Charged by Tesla) may apply if car is left more than 5 minutes at a Tesla supercharger stall after charging is complete when at least 50% of stalls are occupied (does not apply to destination chargers)


 💦 CLEAN CAR 💦

I always provide my renters with clean cars (exterior and interior) so please try to return the car as it was when you picked it up. For your convenience, you can skip this step but a car wash fee may apply (cost reimbursed through Turo)

👣  If the “interior” comes back stained, muddy, dusty/sandy, signs of spillage, food, foul odor | odor of smoke (non smoking car), a cleaning fee up to $150 may apply (up to $250 for severe cleaning.)

🚫❌No pets to in order to keep a allergen free environment 🐶🐱🐾 $200 cleaning fee if soiled with animal fur and other messy situations.

❗️If the car is dirty and you cannot find a car wash, that’s fine, but a car wash fee ($20) may be applied;
Do not try to “wipe” the dirt off the car; This will scratch the paint and would trigger a claim through Turo.

⚠️⚠️NO SMOKING/VAPING: If there is a smoke/cigarette smell or traces of ash found in the car, a cleanup fee of up to $150 may apply.

🚨🚦🚔 All Fines/traffic violations are the sole responsibility of the guest during the rental period.

🏷 All toll fees triggered (including device administrative fee) during your booking will be request through Turo a few days after the vehicle is returned.

I know that was a lot to read but the car is worth it:) Rent with me and see what the hype is about‼️It’s Definitely the ride of the future🚀
