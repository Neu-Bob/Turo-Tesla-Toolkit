For your convenience, the guidelines for each car is already printed out and laminated- you will find it on the seat in each car before your trip. 

Please take great care of this car. Absolutely NO open food, drinks (besides water, coffee or tea if careful), pets, or smoking (of any kind) in (or before getting into) the car, reckless driving, offroading, etc. I am very strict on these requests

Vehicle will be charged up in preparation for your trip. At all times during your trip, please keep battery charge level between 10%-85% (No overnights below 10% please) and return the car with at least 20% charge in it to help preserve the battery. I will go through this with you in person.

You may be responsible for the all charging costs incurred during the trip (one full charge is roughly $13-15) 

I will go through the charging details with you in person, as well as how to drive the car and all the bells and whistles. 

This car is very easy to drive, and I'll go over the advanced features and give you a full "tech tour" of the vehicle if you want it. 

Keeping the car overnight? Please be mindful of parking situation and advise you not to park on the street in a bad neighborhood. If you notice the battery at 10% or lower, please charge the car before letting it sit overnight. If this happens, a text warning will be sent followed by possible vehicle damage fee (Not good for the battery).    

Charging (full charge around $12-15 and takes around 45mins with supercharger) can be done at any Tesla supercharger, public L2 charger (J1772 and Tesla connectors only), or at home (through provided universal Tesla Charger). Please make sure to plan your trip accordingly and know where youâ€™ll need to charge. Call or text me anytime for assistance with charging. I will explain how to supercharge in more detail.  

In addition, San Francisco and areas are full of speed bumps. up/down hills, and curbs in the middle of the road. While it is such a joy to accelerate fast, please be mindful of all of these while having fun. Please be mindful NOT to scratch the bottom of front bumper if going down any steep roads. Physical damage will be checked upon return. Furthermore, you shouldn't have to go more than 100 mph, if this becomes apparent, a reasonable speed limit (90) may be activated). This would be for both your safety and for my car.

Cleanliness: Please return the car in as-good or better condition than when you borrowed it. NO smoking and NO pets please (If you have a beloved pet for your trip, please inform me ahead of time and will see what we can do), If there is unusual staining, smells (Smoke smells are very difficult to get rid of, and would incur a substantial smell removal fee), damages, etc,  Turo may charge a fee. 

This car is in excellent condition and I plan on keeping it that way.

If outside gets little dirty, just let me know and return it as is. There won't be any charges, I'd prefer to hand wash the car myself
