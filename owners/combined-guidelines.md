# Overview

For your convenience, you will find a printed and laminated copy of the guidelines for the rental on the seat before your trip. 

# Remote Monitoring

Do not disable Tesla mobile access.

# Identity verification

You must present a valid driver license at check-in.

# Cleanliness

Please take great care of this car. This car is in excellent condition and I plan on keeping it that way. Please return the car in as-good or better condition than when you borrowed it. A car wash fee may be applied if you return the car dirtier than it was when you picked it up. 

Please be careful with sharp objects than can scratch the leather interior, doors or finish. If outside gets little dirty, just let me know and return it as is. There won't be any charges, I'd prefer to hand wash the car myself. Do not try to ‚Äúwipe‚Äù the dirt off the car. This will scratch the paint and would trigger a claim through Turo.

Absolutely NO:

* smoking or vaping legal or illegal substances in (or before getting into) the car,
* open food,
* drinks (besides water, coffee or tea if careful),
* pets,
* reckless driving, or
* offroading

*RENTERS ARE EXPECTED TO RETURN THE VEHICLE IN THE SAME CONDITION IT WAS DELIVERED*

*EXTERIOR MUST BE CLEAN AND INTERIOR CLEAR OF ANY TRASH OR BELONGINGS. A CLEANING FEE WILL BE CHARGED FOR CARS RETURNED IN AN UNCLEAN CONDITION*

I am very strict on these requests.

There will be a substantial ($150? $250? $750?) cleaning fee charged by Turo if smoking, vaping, pet odor, crumbs, unusual staining, smells or stickiness is detected in the vehicle. Smoke smells are very difficult to get rid of, and would incur a substantial smell removal fee.

*Renter may choose post trip cleaning ‚ÄúExtra‚Äù for a worry free check-out for $20

# Damage to Vehicle or Accessories

Please be very careful to not hit curbs or potholes with the vehicle.  The wheels are difficult and expensive to repair. While it is such a joy to accelerate fast, please be mindful of speed bumps, steep hills and curbs in the middle of the road while having fun. A fee of $200 for each wheel with curb damage will be assessed.  If tires have any rubber gashes or divots there will be a $250 charge for each tire. The tread depth will be checked before and after rentals. Do not do burnouts.

Please be mindful NOT to scratch the bottom of front bumper if going up or down any steep roads or driveway entrances. Physical damage will be checked upon return. The Tesla Model 3 is a very heavy vehicle, weighing in at almost 4,000 lbs because of the weight of the battery. Furthermore, you shouldn't have to go more than 100 mph, if this becomes apparent, a reasonable speed limit (90) may be activated). This would be for both your safety and for my car. Above all, please be careful at all times.

Keeping the car overnight? Please be mindful of parking situation and we advise you not to park on the street in a bad neighborhood. If you see a "Sentry alert" on the center console any time you get in the car and spot damage to the vehicle, please notify us immediately.

Please notify us immediately of any major incidents and minor incidents upon returning the vehicle.

# EV Charging

Since this is an electric vehicle, you must keep an eye on the charge level of the main battery. Please keep the battery charge level between 10% and 80% at all times. The easiest way to charge is at any Tesla supercharging location, which can be found via the navigation system. You will be charged $0.29 per kWh (kilowatt hour) of electricity.  Under normal driving conditions, the vehicle consumes 1 kWh for every 3 miles driven, so this fee will generally be roughly $0.29 x 1/3 of the miles driven. Thus, if you drive 1000 miles, you can expect to pay about $96 in supercharging fees. These charges will be invoiced to you after the vehicle is returned, usually within 48 hours.

Compared to a typical gas vehicle that gets 25 mpg, with a gasoline price of $3.00 per gallon, 1000 miles would cost about $120. 

You may also use an adapter included with the car that allows you to charge using standard J-1772 plugs. Note that not all public chargers are free. You may also use the included Tesla Mobile Charger to charge the car from a regular household outlet or a dryer outlet if one is installed in the garage where you will be staying. The Tesla charger included with the car cannot charge the car fast enough from a standard household outlet, but should be able to fully recharge the car overnight when connected to a dryer plug.

**I will be notified when the charge level reaches 10% and I will be monitoring to ensure you begin charging shortly. Do not drive much further and do not park at a low charge level overnight. This is bad for the battery and may result in a vehicle damage assessment charged to you by Turo.**

The vehicle will be charged up in preparation for your trip. Please return the car with at least 20% charge in it to help preserve the battery. You will be assessed a fee if you leave the car in a state where I cannot drive it to a supercharger.

I set the car to show remaining battery percentage as the remaining range view is only an estimate. It can vary based on road conditions, geography, temperature, speed, and weather and is not reliable. If you allow the vehicle to run out of power, you will need to have the vehicle towed on a flat-bed truck at your own expense to the nearest supercharger, as well as pay for any damage that might be incurred from such towing. You will also be assessed a vehicle damage fee for harming the battery. 

Additionally, if you lose or damage the charging cables or adapters, you will be charged $350 for replacement. Using only Tesla superchargers or Destination Chargers found on the center console navigation system relieves you from using any of the provided cables and adapters.

**You will be responsible for covering all fees related to charging regardless of how the car car is charged. Note that Turo now provides an unlimited supercharging option for $20/day. This allows for easy, low-stress road trips.**

**Note that Tesla charges $1/minute if you leave a fully charged car sitting at a busy supercharger. Turo's unlimited supercharging option does not cover these fees. Please move the car as soon as it is done charging at a supercharger. Other chargers rarely charge these fees.**

Please make sure to plan your trip accordingly. You should know where you‚Äôll need to charge and how to plug the car in to start charging. Free apps like PlugShare and A Better Route Planner can help take all the stress out planning your charging stops. Companies like Airbnb and Hilton have partnered with Tesla to provide free overnight charging to their guests at many locations. Take advantage of this to start off every day with "a full tank". Call me any time with questions relating to the operation and charging of the vehicle. I want you to have an enjoyable experience above all.

# Tolls and Violations

üè∑ Feel free to bring and use your own EZ-Pass or other electronic toll tags during the rental. All toll fees triggered (including device administrative fee) during your booking will be forwarded to you through Turo a few days after the vehicle is returned.

If you are ticketed for any reason please let us know immediately upon return. All fines or traffic violations are the sole responsibility of the guest during the rental period, including but not limited to speed tickets arriving by mail after your rental period has ended.

# Extending Trips

If you'd like to extend your trip, please go into your trip in the app and select CHANGE TRIP. I will allow you to extend the trip so long as the calendar is open. This will prevent a late fee and does not require you to call support.

# Summary

At the end of the day, this car is fun and very easy to drive. I'll go over the advanced features and give you a full "tech tour" of the vehicle if you like.

I know that was a lot to read but the car is worth it :) Rent with me and see what the hype is about‚ÄºÔ∏è It‚Äôs Definitely the ride of the futureüöÄ
