# How to Charge a Tesla

Tesla, like most electric vehicles (EVs) can use a variety of methods to charge up the main battery. If you are planning on driving a few hundred miles, it is critical that you have a charging strategy both during the drive and at your destination. Teslas can be charged in a variety of ways, but each method has its own pros and cons.

## Connector Plugs

First and foremost, it is important to understand the two main connector plugs that can be used to charge the car. There is a Tesla-branded connector included with the car and found at some charging stations and there is also a universal charging connector, called a J-1772 plug. J-1772 plugs can charge virtually any electric vehicle, but you must an adapter included with the car in order to charge a Tesla with it. There is no need to use an adapter when charging the car with a Tesla-branded plug.

## Charging Speeds

In addition to the connector type, it is also important to understand the differences in available charging speeds. You may have heard that Tesla-branded Superchargers use the Tesla proprietary connector when plugging into the car, but that does not mean that you will always charge the car at supercharging speeds just because you're using a Telsa proprietary plug. The voltage and current provided by the charging equipment directly impact how quickly the charging station recharges the car. And the charging speeds can vary quite a bit.

If you use a regular household outlet with the charging cable included with the car, you will charge the car at a rate of about 3 miles per hour. That means it would take about three days to fully charge up a fully depleted car. Not a fun way to spend your rental! However, if you happen to rent from an Airbnb property with a Tesla-branded charger, chances are they've outfitted the charger with higher power. That, in turn, could charge the car at a much faster rate, often about 30 miles per hour, or enough to fully recharge the car after a day of touring your vacation spot. Finally, if you can't charge the car wherever you're staying, you can always visit a Tesla Supercharger if one is nearby or along your planned travel route. Superchargers have honestly earned their names because you can charge a nearly-depleted Tesla Model 3 or Y at one of the newest superchargers at up to 1,000 miles per hour! The car is usually charged enough to give you a few more hours on the road after just 15 minutes. That's barely enough time to hit the bathroom and get a drink.
