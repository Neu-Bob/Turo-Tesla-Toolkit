# Model 3 and Y

In this section, you will find tips specific to renters of the Tesla Model 3 or Model Y.

## Unlocking the Car

As you walk up to the car, you will tap the keycard given to you as part of the rental on the 'B pillar', the vertical bar on each side of the car that separates the front doors from the rear doors. You will know that you have successfully unlocked the car when the horn gives two short honks and the mirrors unfold into the ready position.

## Starting the Car

When you sit down in the driver's seat, the main center display will show you where to tap the keycard in order to start the car. Press the brake with your foot, and tap the keycard in the small flat area located between the cup holders and the center arm rest. You do not need to leave the keycard there in order to keep driving the car.

## Driving the Car

Now that you've started the car, keep your foot on the brake and either press or lift the Drive Mode Selector Arm (the right stalk behind the steering wheel) all the way (beyond the click) until the arm will not travel any further. Lift the right stalk all the way up to put the car in Reverse or push the right stalk all the way down to put the car in Drive. Look in the top left corner of the center display for the gear indicator to change to a speedometer as an indicator that you have successfully put the car in gear.
