# Renters Tips

Welcome to the `renters` section of the site. Here, you will find tips and tricks for driving a Tesla and for getting the most out of your rental experience. You will find basic instructions for opening, starting, driving, parking, locking, and charging the car. You will learn how to use some of the Advanced Driver Assist System technologies designed to reduce the stress of driving on the highway.

Within this section, you will find the tips and tricks grouped together in pairs. The Tesla Model 3 and Model Y are very similar vehicles so their content will be grouped together in the Model 3-Y folder. Similarly, the Model S and Model X are similar enough to have their content grouped together.

We hope you find this information helpful and contributes to an excellent rental experience you have with us.
